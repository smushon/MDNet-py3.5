# my cs231n project

Hi, my name is Moshe Karl.
I was a student in the 2nd annual cs231n course organized by the admins of Machine & Deep learning Israel community.

This is the code for my object tracjing project.
My presentation can be found here (it's the last one) - https://machinelearning.co.il/3653/dlcourse-final-2/#more-3653

This is not the prettiest code around, but it works. 
Usage can be understood from the code.
Some parameters are not commandline, instead should edit code.
