# my cs231n project

Hi, my name is Moshe Karl.
I was a student in the 2nd annual cs231n course organized by the admins of Machine & Deep learning Israel community.

This is the code for my object tracking capstone project.
My presentation can be found here (it's the last one) - https://machinelearning.co.il/3653/dlcourse-final-2/#more-3653

In short, 
I created a deep neural network for refining the output of tracking networks.

Was integrated with MDNet for demonstration purpose. Why MDNet? No special reason, but once started playing with it, decided to stick with it and base my project on it.
